# Life_Insurance

My project name is Life_Insurance where I have created a User And Admin Modules and performed CRUD operations using Python and MySQL. Data entered by the user are stored in MYSQL database in tabular form. The Best Part of this code is that it is 100 % user friendly because of excess use of exceptional handling.In the project we are having new user and existing exister based on the choice entered by the user the operations are going to perform. In this project , Admin only have access to perform Update Insert And Delete operations. Based on the type of Insurance type selected by user that particular operations are going to happen with strict validations and admin will take care of all security related things about user personal information as I have created some user name and password in which admin can only have access to give once personal information.
